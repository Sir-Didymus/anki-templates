# anki-templates

This repository contains the anki templates I use for my studies.

## `my_templates`

`my_templates` contains templates I have designed myself.
Feel free to use and modify them as you see fit.

## `shared_templates`

`shared_templates` contains templates that come from shared anki decks.
I have modified these templates to my liking,
mostly to make them look like my own cards for consistancy.

These card templates are not my own.
I have them on github for versioncontrol and backup.
If available, the licenses of the respective templates apply.
